      <title>New years and Resolutions</title>

      <guid>https://aparajith21.github.io/post/new-years-and-resolutions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So 2020 is finally over and it’s the start of a new year. Many of us make a resolution at the beginning of the year, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.westernconnecticuthealthnetwork.org/newsroom/article-listing/new-years-resolutions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;fewer than 10% keep it for more than a few months&lt;/a&gt;. Personally, I don’t believe in the concept of resolutions - they’re nugatory and pointless in my opinion- yet I will attempt one this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, when I was younger, I used to be a voracious reader and read far too many books, some of which were too advanced for my age. But to my shock, I’ve completely lost the habit of reading books - to the best of memory, I read exactly one book last year (Vishy Anand’s autobiographical ‘Mind Master’). I wouldn’t say I have lost the habit of &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; - I did read a lot of academic papers last year, but they do not lend themselves for casual discussion with friends and family- I’ve just lost the habit of reading &lt;em&gt;books&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to rectify that this year, and hence I make a resolution to read 52 books this year, one every week. I’m going to read books that I haven’t read before and also re-read some books, both non-fiction (to see how I interpret them with my more mature outlook) and fiction (for entertainment). I confess that when I was younger, the distribution of books I read would be 80-20 in favour of fiction against non-fiction. I hope to change that as well and bring down the disparity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’m not going to force my progression to be linear - some books deserve more time than others and some weeks I may not feel like reading a book- and expect myself to read exactly one book a week. Such an expectation would be the downfall of this resolution as it would cause unnecessary anxiety and even make reading books a  &lt;em&gt;chore&lt;/em&gt; or something to be ticked off a list instead of provoking thought and providing entertainment and recreation (I believe a major reason for the collapse of resolutions is the anxiety it causes and the way it makes a task chore-like). Nor am I going to be a pedant and consider it a failure if I don’t read 52 books. I will be satisfied if I return to the habit of reading books this year and keep to the &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt; of the resolution, regardless of the number of books I read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am posting this on the internet so that it offers me some motivation and negative reinforcement. I don’t want someone reading this (if at all anyone visits this website), and showing a screenshot later next year of how I did not keep to my resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will update the following list of books I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year as and when I finish one. I shall not be keeping count - that will be left for the pedants out there. Wish me luck for I will need it to be among the 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Letter Rain</title>
      <link>https://aparajith21.github.io/post/letter-rain/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Letter Rain is an original interactive PC game developed using the
PyGame library. The game tests your focus and vocabulary by challenging
you to form words from the falling letters before they sink into the
water below. Speed and accuracy are key factors to excel in this game,
apart from of course, a slice of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gameplay&#34;&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gameplay is very simple and intuitive. There will be letters falling
from the sky into the river below. The objective of the game is to form
meaningful words from those letters before it falls into the river and
score points. The player can form words by pressing the key in the
keyboard corresponding to the falling letter. Once a player is satisfied
with the word formed, they can press Return on the keyboard for score
counting and then to continue with the next word. At each level, there
is a predefined target score that the player must achieve in order to
progress to the next level. Each level is of the same fixed duration of 1 minute. Within this duration the player
must achieve atleast the target score to progress. The game will end if the player fails to score atleast the target score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look into the Game&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>US Elections 2020: A battle for conscience</title>
      <link>https://aparajith21.github.io/post/us-elections-2020-a-battle-for-conscience/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aparajith21.github.io/post/us-elections-2020-a-battle-for-conscience/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m no expert on US politics, but I&amp;rsquo;m anyway sharing my thoughts here on this election in the world’s oldest democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this unprecedented pandemic, unemployment rates had fallen, consumer confidence was rising, home sales were also on the rise and the stock market in the US was booming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of that has since changed this year thanks to the coronavirus.
Most people would agree that the US President hasn’t handled the pandemic well in terms of loss of life and damage to health, but the economy in the US isn’t too worse off either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is the US so bitterly divided with no clear result yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Mr Biden does end up becoming the next President, it doesn’t take anything away from the fact that almost half of the US has voted for Mr Trump! It will be a political victory for Mr Biden but not a victory for equity and fairness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’re willing to chalk off Mr Trump’s handling of this pandemic given its unprecedented nature, he’s done well in terms of the economy, with jobs created and people occupied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty much all you can give to the President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socially, the US is more divided than ever, with a President who turns the other way when minorities are targeted, who doesn’t even pretend to care about a large portion of his nation boiling over in anger. He’s treated the situation with complete apathy and disregard resulting in massive polarisation of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who did vote for Mr Trump can be classified into two types: those unaffected by the systemic racism and targeting of minorities, and two, those that are indeed concerned but lacking the conscience to look beyond the ‘good’ handling of the economy, and engulfed by a twisted sense of &amp;lsquo;patriotism&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, those who are affected probably voted for Mr Biden. But what about those who did vote for Mr. Trump, and that is almost half of all voters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget the Trump &amp;lsquo;bhakts&amp;rsquo;. It is the rest, who were indeed aware of Mr Trump&amp;rsquo;s true colours but still chose to vote for him without a touch of conscience or morality, that we should be concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tosses and the IPL</title>
      <link>https://aparajith21.github.io/post/tosses-and-the-ipl/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aparajith21.github.io/post/tosses-and-the-ipl/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The toss of a coin signifies the start of every cricket match. The winning captain gets to decide whether his team bats or bowls first. Generally, right from grassroots cricket, the idea that is taught by coaches is to win the toss, bat first, put up a good total and then defend it. And this is still relevant in test match cricket and is what usually happens, unless there’re absurdly windy conditions or conditions favourable to bowling, teams win the toss and bat first stating the reason that the pitch will likely erode over five days making it difficult for the team that bats last&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s slightly different in limited overs cricket, where in cases of day night matches, teams take into consideration factors like dew, that might make it more difficult for the team that bowls second. But even here, it’s mostly bat first, especially in pressure-situations even if there is the likelihood of dew, like how Sri Lanka did against India in the 2011 world cup final in dewy conditions at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in T20 cricket, this logic has inverted itself, especially in recent times. In the IPL, between 2008 and 2012 (inclusive of both), when T20 cricket was slowly maturing from the infant it was in 2008 to the toddler in 2012, teams which won the toss chose to bat and field first roughly half the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the tide has changed rapidly. Toss winning teams nowadays prefer to field first and chase down a target that they know. Between 2013 and 2016 (inclusive of both), teams that won the toss chose to field first 61% of the time, a significant increase from the 50% in the preceding five seasons. Teams batted first only if they were sure that the pitch would deteriorate significantly through the match. Teams that won the toss and bowled first won the game 54% of the time and teams that won the toss and batted first won only 43% of the time. Make of that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been another massive shift since 2016. T20 cricket has grown up some more and between 2017 and 2019 (inclusive of both), teams that won the toss chose to field first an incredible 83% of the time! This decision lead the toss winning team to victory 58% of the time whereas teams that won the toss and chose to bat first were able to justify their decision 51% of the time, over the 43% in the previous 4 years. So teams that chose to bat first were somewhat smarter with their decision compared to earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPLs between 2017 and 2019 were all held in India, and the current one is happening in the UAE. Here too teams have chosen to field first in most of the initial games, though the trend is changing now though, with Kolkata Knight Riders choosing to bat first against CSK (toss occurred at the time of writing) in the 33rd time of asking since they last batted first in 2015! Maybe it’s because there’s hardly any dew present to mitigate the general slowdown of the pitch that teams are going back to batting first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the reason for this field first craze? Results are not too skewed in the favour of the team that chooses to field first (58-42) to justify this. There could be many reasons, if I am to guess, it is probably due to the pitches being relatively easy to bat on throughout and it’s simply easier to chase a target than to set one, plus the dew factor..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In IPL finals though, 7 out of 12 times, the team winning the toss chose to bat first, and weirdly, both the toss winning teams in the first 2 seasons of the IPL fielded first (1 W, 1 L). Of the 4 latest finals though, the team winning the toss has won each of the finals and in 3 of the 4 finals, the toss winning team chose to bat first, interestingly, in contrast to how toss winning teams generally chose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting factoid is that of the 4 finals Mumbai and Chennai have contested, the team that batted first won every time, and in 3 of those finals, the team winning the toss chose to bat first. Mumbai have also won every final in which they batted first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it is upto the cricket experts to shine light on these trends and the decision making of the toss winning teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read this, do ping me with your opinion on this!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We started from Chennai on the 22nd of December, flying to Dibrugarh via Kolkata. We reached Dibrugarh at 2 p.m. and were anxious to get out of that place due to the ensuing protests against the CAA. We entered Arunachal at around 4 and reached the Golden Pagoda at Namsai at around 1730 in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Significance of the discovery of Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://aparajith21.github.io/post/significance-of-the-discovery-of-gravitational-waves/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aparajith21.github.io/post/significance-of-the-discovery-of-gravitational-waves/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a bit of a hiatus for me. The extremely over hyped 10th board exams are coming up next month in March. I strongly believe exams must never have a role in deciding the capabilities of a person. Every person will have a field where they&amp;rsquo;re brilliant, only exams won&amp;rsquo;t identify those people. Extremely smart people might still fail to perform to the best of their abilities during examinations due to various reasons- from pressure to exam fear. One day, when I take humans to Mars, I will make sure that the first thing that is instituted is a proper education system. &lt;em&gt;Sighs and wakes up to realize I&amp;rsquo;m still a nobody and we&amp;rsquo;re still on Earth with my Boards in a month.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to get to the topic and the purpose of writing this article, which I just could not resist writing being a science fanatic, despite pressures from family, friends and teachers to seriously spend time studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gravitational waves are basically ripples in the space-time continuum or the fabric of space and time, the existence of which was brilliantly predicted by Albert Einstein almost a century ago(98 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass bends space. In a more simple way, take space to be like a long piece of sponge. If you apply pressure on the sponge, it bends due to mass of your hand right? The harder you press, the more it bends. Similarly, due to the gravitational forces of various bodies, space gets &amp;lsquo;bent&amp;rsquo; and disturbed from its original position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gravity doesn&amp;rsquo;t act as a force, in fact there are no &amp;lsquo;forces&amp;rsquo; in the gravitational pull, it is actually because due to the mass of both the objects, space bends due to which the objects move closer to each other. Now, imagine two ends of a paper sheet. Mark an edge as &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s opposite side as &amp;lsquo;B&amp;rsquo;. Now to go from an edge to the other, you need to go via the diagonal right? Now, what happens if you fold the sheet via the other diagonal. This reduces the distance and now A is literally on B right? This is exactly what happens when celestial bodies attract each other due to a bend in space time caused by the mass of their bodies(gravity), only there is more space between them unlike when A is on top of B(LOL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANYTHING with MASS and ENERGY can create gravitational force(even me and you). If you run around, even then you cause ripples in the fabric of space-time, although it will be undetectable and very, very, very small. Now, to cause such a massive distortion, you need something very very big moving very, very fast for us to detect it. This is why gravitational waves were possible to be detected only from 2 massive black holes moving at incredible speeds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes coming to it now, there is only one way to detect gravitational waves which bend space and time. Take a guess. And before taking one, let me give you the facts. Say you want to measure the distance between A and B which is originally 10 cm. Even if you make markings equally spaced between each other, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to notice and detect any change, as a bend in the space-time continuum say which causes A and B to come closer will also cause the markings to come closer, so you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to identify any difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing which doesn&amp;rsquo;t get stretched is light(the speed). Say due to the disturbances, the distance between A and B gets stretched further, then light will take more speed to reach B and if it gets bent and becomes smaller, then light will take lesser time to reach B. This is exactly how they detected the existence of gravitational waves at LIGO(Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory). There are 2 tunnels there, perpendicular to each other, When a gravitational wave is detected, one of the tunnels stretches while the other contracts. The interference of the lasers as the waves bounce between the different points in the vertex is measured to check whether space-time has been bent or not. It is super mega ultra giga difficult to do this and successfully measure the differences. Like say measuring a difference of 50 cm from the original size of a rod which is 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,00 m long. I bet you can&amp;rsquo;t even read the number correctly! Adding to the difficulties is the extra noise which heightens the difficulty of successfully detecting a gravitational wave. This is done by comparing the ripples gotten in experiments to the ones in actual space-time ripples. It&amp;rsquo;s like a 10000 different songs being played at the same time and you&amp;rsquo;re trying to identify a melody whose volume is the lowest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of this achievement is well, SIGNIFICANT as it provides a completely different view and perception of the universe. Until today, gravity was thought of as a normal force. But now, it has been clearly proven that space and time can be bent. You can now look at things from a totally different angle. Like say, you initially were only able to see 2 dimensions, but now you&amp;rsquo;re able to see the 3rd and this completely changes your understanding of the world, nothing is flat anymore. It is absolutely incredible how a man who lived almost a century ago, was able to see with such foresight and predict such an &amp;lsquo;absurd&amp;rsquo; thing as this. Maybe he was born in a future world and he traveled back in time and unfortunately lost his time machine and enlightened the world earlier than when it was supposed to understand various stuffs. If he did that, the consequences would possibly only be known to him and could affect the world adversely. Oh hell, only the worst critic of Einstein would put forth such a theory and somehow manage to criticize him. For all we know, Einstein was a great man, a fabulous human being who has made the world a more knowledgeable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now that it has been proven that space time is like a sheet which can be bent, I just can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the sheet to become 3 dimensional! That&amp;rsquo;ll deepen further our understanding of the research able
universe.
This is one great step in the quest for knowledge and understanding of the universe and the physics behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dreams</title>
      <link>https://aparajith21.github.io/post/dreams/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aparajith21.github.io/post/dreams/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We dream about 2-6 times almost every night(or day), but we never wonder what they actually are and most of the time, you forget what you dreamt of when you wake up and even sometimes when you remember, you just put it aside and focus on more worldy thoughts. None of us realize though, that our  brains can think the clearest and deepest while we&amp;rsquo;re dreaming. So here&amp;rsquo;s how I understand dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would define a dream as ideas, emotions and thoughts that converge to form a sort of a movie in your head which you sometimes can, but sometimes can&amp;rsquo;t control. Although I&amp;rsquo;m no oneirologist or a psychoanalyst, this is my view about dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, dreams usually materialize based on my last thought before falling asleep. So, therefore before going to bed, I think about stuff which I like and stuff which I wonder a lot about, like Chelsea winning, rebelling against your genetic composition etc, and sometimes when I&amp;rsquo;m in my dream I command the world and can therefore try different scenarios to put to bed my curiosities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you&amp;rsquo;re fully conscious, there are stuff which are highly impossible to successfully recreate in the conscious world. In a dream, even the sky is not the limit. You can achieve ANYTHING in a dream. The world belongs to you. All you need to do is know how to control it. They can help you get creative and give a sense of inspiration and ideas. You can actually solve problems better in your dreams than in a conscious state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreams can also be re-visualizations of good or scary moments of the past which affect you emotionally, either causing anxieties and fears or happiness and nostalgia. You dream about happy moments of the past which you wish to relive or about repressed memories and phobias during which you fathom about what would happen if such a thing were to occur in real life. You go through different possibilities, of how you could&amp;rsquo;ve made a good moment better, or of how you&amp;rsquo;d react were to be placed in an unpleasant situation which you fear while conscious. You get ideas on how to tackle such situations and to beat your fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, in rare cases, you will come to understand that you&amp;rsquo;re dreaming. How you do varies from person to person. Like for me, during rare instances when I suspect that I&amp;rsquo;m dreaming, a door with a sunflower on it suddenly appears which makes realization dawn on me. I have absolutely no idea why it&amp;rsquo;s a sunflower door nor can I change it. It has been the same from when I was young and is probably because of my experiences then. If I choose to stay, I can sort of influence the events in the world of dreams, but I also wake up if I open the door and walk through it. I have no idea why this is so and find it incredibly bizarre. This is basically known as lucid dreaming. You are aware that you&amp;rsquo;re dreaming and sometimes, can even control and influence the events occurring in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreams consolidate newer memories and reinforce older ones combining them with your thoughts to provide you a better view and ideas to sate your curiosities and abate your deepest desires which widely vary from person to person. They help in enlightening you and broadening your view on subjects. They also serve as reminders for things which you should do in the future or bring back visions of people who were in your life in the past who you dearly miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, they also serve as warnings for future occurrences which may probably take place due to a series of events culminating into one big showdown. Sometimes, people get premonitions or visions about future events that are going to take place. Many put forth a religious and spiritual point of view to these &amp;lsquo;premonitions&amp;rsquo; like astrology, divination, necromancy etc but this is my view on this. Some people have a very good IQ(Intelligence Quotient). Usually, these are the ones who get these visions about the future in their dreams. I would say this is because their mind is sharp enough to analyse certain small and seemingly insignificant events, but all of which might have possible consequences. There are people who have &amp;lsquo;predicted&amp;rsquo; future disasters and are being called &amp;lsquo;Oracles&amp;rsquo; or so but they are probably those whose minds are intelligent enough to put together a few factors which might cause a disaster in which man might have had a role to play. Like say, in EM Forster&amp;rsquo;s, the Machine Stops, although he wrote it as science fiction, he was able to successfully predict a world which is highly dependent on machines and the Internet and instant messaging services back in 1909. He had such good foresight, that it almost seems as if he travelled through time and wrote the book back in 1909. These kinds of people have incredible IQs and could possibly be able to put together events which may culminate with them predicting the final event in the future subconsciously. They are basically the ones we revere and call Oracles. At least, that is my opinion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult part I face is that about 90% of the time, when I realize that I&amp;rsquo;m dreaming, I wake up and am unable to continue the dream. It is very difficult to maintain a subconscious state once you realize that what you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing isn&amp;rsquo;t real and has no effect on you. But after a while, sometimes you master it, and for sometime you control the world of dreams where the Laws of Physics don&amp;rsquo;t apply and you can try out different things which you&amp;rsquo;d have always wanted to do in real life. You can also gain answers to questions and be inspired by the happenings of a dream. But, sometimes, instead of being affected by the outside environment and waking up, the brain incorporates this as a part of the dream resulting in continued sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toughest part though is to recall and remember a dream, and even when you do it is extremely unreliable as most of the time, you mix reality with the dreamscape and get an altered version of the dream. But, that said, if you awake while in the middle of the dream, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to fully recall and remember it, but what use is it when you wake up while in the middle of solving something. Mostly, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to recall dreams which are vivid and interesting in content making you curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, this is my interpretation of dreams. If your dreams don&amp;rsquo;t scare you, they aren&amp;rsquo;t big enough, so dream big!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Not taking anything away from EM Forster for he was one of the best science fiction writers in the world. Plus, this is just my view of a dream, you may not agree with this, but this is what I believe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Chelsea Calamity</title>
      <link>https://aparajith21.github.io/post/the-chelsea-calamity/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://aparajith21.github.io/post/the-chelsea-calamity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The club from West London which strolled to the title with remarkable ease and ruthless efficiency last season is now struggling to compete even against weaker sides like Bournemouth and West Ham United. No one would have foreseen such a weak capitulation by a side that won the league with 4 games to spare last season.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://aparajith21.github.io/post/2015-12-08-the-chelsea-calamity/chelsea1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Trophy pic&#34;&gt;
But Chelsea are struggling, and although I&amp;rsquo;m no football analyst, this is my point of view on why they are. Various small reasons have built up to make the Blues look like any other ordinary side and not one which has the likes of Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa and Oscar, not to mention Pedro, Willian, Matic and John Terry.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://aparajith21.github.io/post/2015-12-08-the-chelsea-calamity/chelsea2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Struggling Hazard&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;different-preseason-strategy-used-by-jose-mourinho&#34;&gt;Different preseason strategy used by Jose Mourinho&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last season we had a lengthy preseason in which Jose made sure every player was fit, in form and match ready. We played dazzling football in the first half of last season ripping opposition defenses apart. But, due to a lengthy preseason, many players witnessed a dip in form( Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa, Oscar, Matic) in the middle of the season. But the defense in the first half of last season was a bit leaky, the games against Everton(6-3) and Swansea(4-2) a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Years Day match against Tottenham when we were beaten 5-3, Jose Mourinho realized that all out attack wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take us all the way and so we became more defensive, winning matches by slender margins and riding on Eden Hazard&amp;rsquo;s consistently sparkly performances.
To avoid this mid-season dip in form, Jose went for a different strategy going for a shorter preseason and knowing that we will have a slow start but hoping that there&amp;rsquo;d be no midseason slump and that we&amp;rsquo;d peak at the right time. Unfortunately, thanks to the players taking lengthy holidays with complacency creeping in, Jose had no idea how unfit really his squad was. Diego Costa literally had a belly and Hazard, already a notoriously slow starter was even worse off. The defense was defending like it didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to defend and Fabregas, Oscar looked like they had run out of creative ideas.
In the game against Swansea, they scored the same 2 goals that they did last season but we scored only 2 unlike the 4 that we did last season thus drawing the match. Manchester City had a fit, in form squad and they used our weakness, thrashing us 3-0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lack-of-pace-in-the-defense&#34;&gt;Lack of pace in the defense&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 of our defenders, John Terry, Gary Cahill and Branislav Ivanovic are extremely slow. All the opposition needed to do was outpace them which wasn&amp;rsquo;t a tough task. Add that to their not being in form and it became a party for the opposition. Worse yet, Ivanovic was still going forward, and he&amp;rsquo;s in the worst form amongst the defenders and couldn&amp;rsquo;t track back or tackle the opponents. He literally gave crosses away and didn&amp;rsquo;t at all look to tackle or block them. No one could have expected this from the best right back in the premier league of last season. John Terry is aging and Gary Cahill already doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much pace. Zouma and Azpilicueta provide some hope. Perhaps Jose was not expecting Everton to hold back John Stones and didn&amp;rsquo;t give them the rigorous training that they needed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://aparajith21.github.io/post/2015-12-08-the-chelsea-calamity/chelsea3.png&#34; alt=&#34;Non existent midfield line&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inexistent-defensive-line-by-the-midfield&#34;&gt;Inexistent defensive line by the midfield&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early season, there was literally no protection offered by the midfielders for the defenders. Once we lose possession in their half, they could easily counterattack, with no one to stop them but Matic whom we heavily depended on last season and who is one of the main reasons for our defensive frailties. Nobody else even tried to challenge the opposition and whenever Fabregas tried, he was dribbled past way too easily. Eden Hazard and Willian looked too much into attack, Cesc Fabregas may be a brilliant attacking option, but he isn&amp;rsquo;t the same defensively, Nemanja Matic was totally out of form too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://aparajith21.github.io/post/2015-12-08-the-chelsea-calamity/chelsea4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Diego Costa&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;diego-costas-bad-form&#34;&gt;Diego Costa&amp;rsquo;s bad form&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole teams bad form could be attributed to in terms of poor defensive performances but in attack, even though Cesc Fabregas and Oscar aren&amp;rsquo;t in form, Eden Hazard is always a notoriously slow starter and that didn&amp;rsquo;t affect the team much last season, plus Willian is in the form of his life creating chance after chance which Diego Costa isn&amp;rsquo;t making much use of. Unlike last season, when Diego converted half chances into chances and took them, he isn&amp;rsquo;t able to do that or even take good chances. Your whole team suffers especially when your striker isn&amp;rsquo;t in form as if you can&amp;rsquo;t get the goal, you can&amp;rsquo;t win the match even if you play well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the whole team is getting back to form and making some good progress. Hazard once again looks hazardous to the opponent and Fabregas looks like he has finally got some ideas but again, Diego Costa&amp;rsquo;s bad form isn&amp;rsquo;t helping the Blues. Even if you create a million chances, you won&amp;rsquo;t win the game unless you score as evidenced by the team&amp;rsquo;s excellent performance in a losing cause against Bournemouth last weekend. Unless we score goals, we won&amp;rsquo;t win the very important knockout Champion&amp;rsquo;s League tie against Porto at home in a couple of days from now and that could very well mean the end of Jose Mourinho if we fail to qualify, as already we&amp;rsquo;ve crashed out of the League Cup, the Premier League is out of our hands. The Champion&amp;rsquo;s League and the FA cup are the only trophies which we can realistically achieve this season. So, come on you Blues, don&amp;rsquo;t disappoint fans again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hyperloop</title>
      <link>https://aparajith21.github.io/post/hyperloop/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-hyperloop&#34;&gt;What is the Hyperloop?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperloop is a revolutionary concept put forth by the real world Ironman, Elon Musk. It will revolutionize transportation and is possibly the next big mode of transportation before warping(soon to be invented).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will operate by sending &amp;lsquo;capsules&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;pods&amp;rsquo; into a steel tube which is maintained at a partial vacuum.&lt;br&gt;
Each pod floats on a small pocket of air under pressure. Magnetic Levitation(usage of magnets to create lift, thus attaining great speeds as the vehicle isn&amp;rsquo;t in contact with the ground) is mostly avoided here, yet it goes at speeds which a wheel can&amp;rsquo;t sustain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linear induction motors are used for acceleration and deceleration of the pod. Linear induction motors are basically ones which have the rotor and stator &amp;lsquo;unrotatory&amp;rsquo; so that instead of producing a torque as in traditional motors, a linear force is produced along its length. Similar to regenerative braking, linear motors too store its power when shifting speeds for future use. This is useful during parts of the journey when the speed is greatly increased or decreased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to no tyres, there&amp;rsquo;ll be highly reduced rolling resistance, and the air resistance too will be reduced. This is what enables to pod to float or glide throughout the journey at great speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a tube which isn&amp;rsquo;t a total vacuum, there&amp;rsquo;s a problem in which the pod slows down due to pressure building up in front of it.  This is solved by placing an electric inlet fan and an air compressor to move highly pressurised air to the back of the pod. The pods will be solar powered and the maximum acceleration will be 0.5g with an average speed of 750 mph. This is basically the proposed model of the Hyperloop in short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://aparajith21.github.io/post/2015-11-17-hyperloop/featured_explanation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;how it works&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-it-going-to-affect-us&#34;&gt;How is it going to affect us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes us 30 hours on Indian roads to travel from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and we spend so much on petrol and fuel. Imagine a travel time of 2 hours approximately at a cost of ₹1000. Even if air travel was possible, it would take us 3-4 hours to travel that distance plus even the cheapest flight fare would at least cost ₹20000, which is 20 times the cost of  travelling by the Hyperloop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://aparajith21.github.io/post/2015-11-17-hyperloop/hyperloop.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;HYPERLOOP TECHNOLOGIES INC.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also weather proof. No matter the conditions, storm, sun or blizzard, this will function. People may say that this is just another similar version of maglev trains, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the big disadvantages that accompany maglev trains ie the huge costs, poor fuel efficiency as levitating requires quite some energy plus the safety is always in question. These are negated in the Hyperloop.
Plus even though, magnetic levitation is put to use here although not to the maglev train level extent, it&amp;rsquo;s energy efficient and utilises solar power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hyperloop basically offers quick transportation and an ecofriendly, weather proof means of transport.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why life will be tough without a bean bag for me</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People may call me stupid as I prefer to live on a bean bag in this terribly hot, tropical climate of India and they may say that it&amp;rsquo;s bad for my health as it &amp;lsquo;traps&amp;rsquo; heat and makes the already hot climate hotter, but for me it is the most comfortable place to sit in, better than any other place I&amp;rsquo;ve sat on as it&amp;rsquo;s extremely flexible, I can change its position to suit me, it lets me sit in all kinds of awkward positions that are comfortable for me , and I think in the scientific point of view, it&amp;rsquo;s extremely comfy as it puts pressure on every single part of your back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t even use the dining table to eat, I use the bean bag for all purposes, whether it&amp;rsquo;s eating, watching TV or doing homework, there is not a place in the world I would rather be sitting on than the bean bag( except in places where the bean bag is there).
For all those who don&amp;rsquo;t know what a bean bag is, quoting Wikipedia &amp;ldquo;A bean bag (also beanbag) is a sealed bag containing dried beans, PVC pellets, expanded polystyrene, or expanded polypropylene with various applications.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;d add the fact that it is the most comfortable thing to sit on!
For any person shopping for chairs, sofas, couches, trust me, I would rather buy a dozen bean bags and put them all over the house. You&amp;rsquo;ll understand my words only when you get yourself a bean bag and sit on it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s only one little problem with getting used to sitting on a bean bag- it makes you lazy as hell and makes every other place you sit in uncomfortable. Even when you&amp;rsquo;re not sitting on it and doing something else, the laziness gets to you and you&amp;rsquo;ll feel like just going, sitting on your bean bag and relaxing!&lt;/p&gt;
